# Simple Pok√©dex App

This is a simple app that uses the PokeApi to display Pokemons and some of their information. In this app you can add Pokemons to your favorites list, and see them in a separate page, the "Team" one.

Obviously this app is not perfect, and there are some things that could be improved, but it's a good starting point for learning React functionalities such as Context, Router, and more. This app is also created as exercise to practice the use of Material-UI components.
